    <p>Over the past six months, Buck et al have been giving it up. On the other hand, Buck has been giving up Buck et al. With his programming job across the ocean, circumstances have called him away from his musical projects, which had to be put on hold. We still shared music, but Buck et al, for the moment, was all but for it.</p>

    <p>Now he's finally returned, and the Buck is back! With a new member, they're fiercer than ever, and eager to be your new best friend. Listen at your caution...
