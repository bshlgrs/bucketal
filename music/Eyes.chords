Eyes

Intro:
G7  C   G7  C
F   G   Ab  Bb  C  Fm  C

Verse 1:
         G7          C         G7         C
When I'm trying to decide if a girl looks nice
         G7          C          G7          C
I don't look at her boobs, no I look in her eyes
            G7            C       G7           C
And when my view of this girl is just from the rear
        G7           C             G7           C
I don't stare at her skirt, I say "turn around dear
          Dm      G        C
Cause I'd like to see your eyes."

Verse 2:
Then she stares at me awkwardly, as I stare in her face
And I'm trying to decide if she's worth an embrace
If I should hug her and then if I feel enough love
I won't go in for a kiss, I'll go slightly above
Yeah I'll go in for her eyes

Chorus:
             F        C         G         C
Cause you'll never go back, not after you try
F             C            G          C
Sticking your tongue into some girl's eye
     F           C                  G           am
Yeah breasts are alright I suppose, I won't say no
           F            G                Ab           Bb            C   Fm  C
But that's not where my tongue wants to, not where my hands want to go

Verse 3:
And the first time I did this it quite changed my life
I added nice eyes to my requirements for a wife
And when she kissed me back, well I knew right then
That she was a lover, not really a friend
Cause we'd traded an eye for an eye

Verse 4:
And what is love if not to share
Those highly sensitive places where
There's lots of nerves, not many people touch
I exaggerate, but not by much
Cause what's more sensitive than the eye

Chorus with different last line:
           F            G                Ab           Bb            Eb
But that's not where my tongue wants to, not where my hands want to go

Bridge:
Eb  B x4

       Eb   B         Eb  B
Why go anywhere, near any hole
         Eb        B      Eb        B  Bb A
When the eye's the window to the soul
        Eb      B     Eb      B
And why risk unwanted pregnancy
         Eb     B            Eb    Bb
When you can't contract that optically?


Chorus 3, transposed to Eb:
             Ab        Eb       Bb         Eb
Cause you'll never go back, not after you try
Ab            Eb          Bb          Eb
Sticking your tongue into some girl's eye
     Ab           Eb                Bb          Cm
Yeah breasts are alright I suppose, I won't say no
           Ab            Bb               B           C#       
But that's not where my tongue wants to, not where my hands want to 
D             E              F            G
Not where my teeth want to, not where my lips want to
Ab           Bb               C   Fm    C    Fm    C   Fm   C
Not where my eyes want to... go
