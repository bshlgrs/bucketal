A Amaj7 A7 D/F# F G D

<b>Verse 1:</b>
          A         Amaj7           A7       D
You're so modestly dressed, but I'm still so impressed
        F           G        D
By the few bits of you I can see
         A              Amaj7       A7              D
And your cross draws my eye to the breasts it hangs by
      F              G              D
How I wish that that necklace were me
          F#m                             E/A
You could take off your shirt, you could take off your skirt
          D                     A       E
You could kiss me and touch me tonight
      F#m                                   E/A
And I know that you want to, it's just your fucking religion
     B                           F
It's telling you that that's not right

<b>Chorus:</b>
                    A
But please don't be frightened, there's nobody out there
                      D                           A
You were born on your own, and you'll die on your own

There's no one to judge you, there's no-one to punish you
                      D                           A
You were born on your own, and you'll die on your own
                      E
And we're here on our own

<b>Verse 2:</b>
You're leaning forward in your chair, and you're twirling your hair
And it's written all over your face
And it's easy to see how you're looking at me
I can tell you don't want to be chaste

But God came from above, says he does not approve of love
Except between just one man and his wife
It's four thousand years later, but still we must wait
Or allegedly we'll be in strife

<b>Repeat chorus.</b>

<b>Bridge:</b>
Bm                        F#m
It's oh so hard to break tradition

I know the truth is hard to take
You know I made the same mistake
Bm                            F#m
It's so hard just to stop and listen
I know the truth is hard to take
You know I made the same mistake
But when your faith begins to break
And where your head begins to shake
You'll realise there's no fiery lake
You'll just do what you want
              A     A/B   A/Bb   A
And you'll be free
A   A/B   A/Bb   A

<b>Repeat chorus.</b>
