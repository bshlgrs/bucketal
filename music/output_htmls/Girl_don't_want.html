<h1>Girl don't want
</h1>
<pre>

<b>Intro:</b>
F  C  G  C
F  G  C  C

<b>Verse 1:</b>
C                     F       G      C
My girlfriend doesn't want me for a boyfriend
                      Am            G
And nothing much could make me more distressed
     C                  F       G         C        Am
It's been so long since she has kissed me properly
     Dm                               G
It's been so long since I've seen her undressed


<b>Verse 2:</b>
It's been so long since I cuddled her for hours
It's been so long since I fumbled with her bra
These days, she parties without me
While I cry over my linear algebra


<b>Chorus:</b>
                F         C
I can be pretty hard to bear
             G                C
I don't have Stephen's facial hair
         F                  C                 G
And if I did, I'm sure that this would all be fine
          F                 C
I'm not a bald guy in the PhB
            G                  C
Or studying third year psychology
    F                    G                     C
And that's the reason my girl don't want to be mine

<b>Repeat intro.</b>

<b>Verse 3:</b>
My girlfriend doesn't want me for a boyfriend
She says she's not sure what she wants instead
She says she wants something less socially constrained
I personally think she just wants Jed

<b>Verse 4:</b>
My girlfriend doesn't want me for a boyfriend
The friend zone seems my certain destination
I wish this meant I'd spend more time on study
But I'll probably just spend more time on masturbation

<b>Chorus 2:</b>
I can be pretty hard to bear
I don't have Stephen's facial hair
And if I did, I'm sure that this would all be fine
Didn't run first div in IB
Or have a fucking girl's name like Casey

    F                     G                 Am
And that's the reason why everything's not fine
    F                     G            Am
And that's the reason why I am always cryin'
     F              G
It's all because my girl don't want to be
Dm              G
All because my girl don't want to be
Dm              G                    C
All because my girl don't want to be mine
