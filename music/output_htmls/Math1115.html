<b>Verse 1:</b>
       C         C7
Math1115, I only did you
            A/F                  Ab/Fm
Cause lots of pretty girls told me to
            G/C                F#/D                  F
I wanted to impress them, then undress them, as they talked about proof by induction

<b>Verse 2.</b>
1115, I thought you'd teach me
Real analysis, and I thought you'd be easy
But you were so frigid, and so rigid, with your assignment marking criteria

<b>Chorus:</b>
               C
But you let me down
            C7               Dm           Ddim
You gave me shitty grades, I needed all HDs
     C              C7             Dm       Ddim
It's cause of you I can't transfer into the PhB
    C                C7            Dm           Ddim
I know how to find a basis, yeah I know what a vector space is
                C           D                     F     G
<b>But you didn't care, so I'm leaving you, yeah I'm doing Math1014</b>
